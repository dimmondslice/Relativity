Relativity

A few things about our game.

-the three finished levels of our game are: OpeningKevan, TheCube, and SpencerTestLevel. the rest are differnt versions of those few, or were cut.all of these should be accessable through the menu

-the num keys 1-6 are for debugging only and will switch your perspective manually without use of a door, they sometimes cause erratic behavior.

-level 1 has a bug where sometimes the door teleporter will switch the player to the wrong perspective. some of the materials on level 2
mysteriously went missing right before our presentaiton, so some things will be covered in pink from the missing materials.
